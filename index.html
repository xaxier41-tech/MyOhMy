    <h1>😅</h1>
    <h4>This might be weird because of how I'm using my knowledge 
        of this but..
    </h4>
    <p>After all the things we been through.. the moment we first started
        speaking to one another over just a instagram story of a crashout game 😂😭😭
        and like how quick we became so close ever time, thats genuinely something I
        can never ever have with anybody else. I'm no doing this because I wanna express my love or whatever
        I'm making all this because I'm actually greatful to have you in my love and stuff. 
        ....Actually I lied 😅🤔 I'm doing this because I wanna show how much you mean to me and how much 
        I love you, Ik probably don't want to have anything with me or anything 
        but I just want you to know that I love you so much. I wanna be that one person who pisses you off all the
        time, the one who also can make you laugh, smile, and feel happy. <span>Just Know I will and would do anything to make you happy
        even if it means losing people..</span>I just want you again..I want us again PLease :(( i miss it all i really do and I'll do anything to have that back.
    </p>
    <h6>But my only question is.. will you allow me to love you like how we used to love eachother??😣🙏💗</h6>
